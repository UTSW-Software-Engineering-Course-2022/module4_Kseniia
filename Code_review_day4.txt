Suzette's Day 3 code performs Burrows â€“ Wheeler Data Transform on a given reference sequence. The BWT algorithm restructures the input sequence in way that allows saving more memory compared to suffix array. Each row in BSW array in a cyclic shift on the input data. The script takes the reference sequence, its suffix array and returns the last columns of the created array. I ran the script, and it works fine. In my opinion memory usage and runtime are good (for me there is no obvious way to improve it). The code is clearly written; there are a few comment lines that are useful for testing but I think they should be removed before releasing the code, however this is a minor issue. Another very minor issue that code writes last BWT column with each nucleotide on the new line, not in one line as given in the sample.bwt example.
