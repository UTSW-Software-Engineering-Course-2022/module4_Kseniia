Khaiâ€™s day 4 script is doing the alignment of queried motifs in the reference sequence using BWT data and suffix array. First the algorithm assigns a rank to each character based on how many times the character has occurred in the sequence. Then it performs FL mapping and queries the position of the chosen motifs. This type of querying supposed to improve memory efficiency compared to the motif alignment that is done based on suffix array only. I ran the script, and it works fine. I think memory usage and the runtime are good. The slowest part of the code is finding the query position. One way to improve the runtime and memory usage is to use improved FM indexing, which is the Day 5 exercise. The code is clearly written; however, I have a few minor notes. I think we were not supposed to use the original reference sequence file, only BWT and suffix array files, however the reference file here was not used to perform the query search, so those lines can be deleted. Some other lines are also redundant (they probably were used for testing). In my opinion the code would be clearer with more comment line explaining different parts of the code.
