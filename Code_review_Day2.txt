Khai’s code makes an alignment for the chosen sequences. The script takes the reference sequence, its suffix array and a file with queries as an input. It outputs a file with positions of each query in the reference sequence. The script performs binary search for each query in the uploaded suffix array.
The algorithm uses suffix array to speed the alignment process. The slowest part of this script is “findPosition” function that performs the binary search. In my opinion the algorithm runtime and memory usage are good enough; I am not aware of other algorithms/approaches that could speed up the computation even more.
The code is clearly written, however, in my opinion more comments would improve the readability of the code.
